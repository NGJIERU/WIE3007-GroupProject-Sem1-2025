# Model: MLP / Neural Network (Person E)

## Model Choice & Justification
[Why MLP? e.g., Captures complex non-linear interactions, "Deep Learning" component]

## Training Config
- Split: 80/20 Stratified (random_state=42)
- Architecture: [e.g., 2 hidden layers (64, 32 units), ReLU activation]
- Optimizer: Adam, Loss: Binary Crossentropy

## Evaluation
| Metric | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| Accuracy | |
| F1-Score | |
| ROC-AUC | |

## Interpretation
[Black-box nature vs performance trade-off]
